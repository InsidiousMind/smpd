## The emulator interfaces for SPC_DSP

Since there is no header file equivalent in Rust, I re-created what I think
would be the equivalent in Rust. I don't even know if this is necessary, but thi
s project is a learning experience, so we shall see.

TODO:
In the future, if there is a better solution, modify this.
