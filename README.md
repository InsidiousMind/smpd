A Simple Music Player Daemon 

A Music Player Daemon written in Rust taking after some of simpler the functionality of MPD. It will store information about music, allow player control + playlist management.

The first format to be supported will be SPC's. Because I want my SNES music. Deal with it.


Thank you to (Blaargs Audio Libraries)[http://www.slack.net/~ant/libs/audio.html] for the SNES emulator in C++. It is the basis for the Rust SNES port.
